# Access Keys & Tokens for mmm-nest-status

## Which Keys & Tokens Do I Need?
You'll need 4 of them:
- Google Cloud Platform OAuth 2.0 Client ID
- Google Cloud Platform OAuth 2.0 Client Secret
- Device Access Project ID
- Device Access Refresh Token

## So ... How Do I Get Them?

Well, the easiest way is to simply follow Google's [Device Access Quick Start Guide](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/get-started). You will, of course, need a Google acount in order to do so.

## Can I Use My Old Nest Developer Account With This Module?

The 2.x version of this module **only** supports the [Google Device Access API](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access).

If you still have an old Nest developer account, you'll need to either migrate it to Google or use the [`1.4.3`](https://github.com/michael5r/mmm-nest-status/tree/1.4.3) version of this module.
